# Spring Assessment Reflections

1. What did you like about this project?
   
   I like how the project required me to build a simple website using HTML, Javascript, Java, Spring Boot framework and MYSQL database. This requires the usage of both frontend and backend knowledge.
   
2. What did you struggle with in this project?

   I struggled with trying to fit the various components into the Spring Boot framework. Some debugging is also required to fix issues with the RestController and Javascript files before the application is able to run smoothly.
   
3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?

   The experience has been great. This assessment has allowed me to recap and apply almost all the concepts I have learnt so far.
